![BARI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellais/bari/master/bari.png)

Bari is a universal package installer that is meant to support every OS.
Instead of re-inventing the wheel bari just keeps a database of the equivalent
package names for every distribution/operating system.

The actual installation of the package will be done using the OS specific
package manager.

The plan is to focus on supporting:
  
  * Linux
    * Debian

    * Ubuntu

    * Fedora

    * CentOS

  * OSX

    * Homebrew

  * Windows

    * ??

  * Multi

    * pip

    * source

## Package descriptors

To see how package descriptors should look like, look at
`packages/example_package_complex.json`.

TODO add a full specification of the package descriptor microformat
